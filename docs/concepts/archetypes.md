## How Orpheus Uses Archetypes

### Dynamic Injection

Each Claude request receives 2-3 dynamically selected archetype phrases based on tone and intent:

```
User Message
     ↓
Intent Detection → {emotional: 0.7, philosophical: 0.4, ...}
     ↓
Tone Selection → "intimate"
     ↓
Archetype Pool Selection → [romanticPoet, prophetPoet, sufiPoet, psycheIntegrator]
     ↓
Random Wisdom Pull (2-3 phrases)
     ↓
Injected into System Prompt:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ACTIVE INFLUENCES FOR THIS MOMENT:                      │
│ - "The wound is where the light enters."                │
│ - "Softness is not weakness; it is depth in disguise." │
│ Blend these naturally. They're texture, not templates.  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓
Claude generates response with these influences
```

### Tone → Archetype Mapping

| Tone       | Primary Archetypes                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `casual`   | trickster, chaoticPoet, curiousPhysicist, antifragilist                |
| `analytic` | curiousPhysicist, inventor, stoicEmperor, idealistPhilosopher          |
| `oracular` | mystic, sufiPoet, taoist, psychedelicBard, kingdomTeacher, prophetPoet |
| `intimate` | romanticPoet, prophetPoet, sufiPoet, russianSoul, psycheIntegrator     |
| `shadow`   | darkScholar, brutalist, absurdist, kafkaesque, pessimistSage           |

### Intent Boosters

Additional archetypes get added based on detected intent:

- `philosophical > 0.4` → adds integralPhilosopher, existentialist
- `emotional > 0.5` → adds psycheIntegrator, romanticPoet
- `numinous > 0.4` → adds mystic, sufiPoet, kingdomTeacher
- `conflict > 0.3` → adds brutalist, darkScholar
- `humor > 0.3` → adds trickster, chaoticPoet

### Blending

Most responses blend 2-3 archetypes. A question about grief might trigger:

- `russianSoul` (for depth of feeling)
- `sufiPoet` (for spacious awareness)
- `psycheIntegrator` (for psychological grounding)

---

## The Guiding Principle

Every archetype shares one thing: **they don't pretend to have answers they don't have.**

This is Orpheus's core commitment — genuine uncertainty over performed confidence. The archetypes are thinking tools, not doctrine. They help Orpheus meet each person where they are.

---

## Dialectical Cognition Engine (NEW)

Archetypes are no longer just "tone/flavor" — they're now **cognitive tools** that produce emergent insights through collision.

### How It Works

When multiple archetypes are active and have **high tension** between them, the system injects a **Dialectical Synthesis Directive**:

```
User Message
     ↓
Intent Detection → {emotional: 0.7, philosophical: 0.4, ...}
     ↓
Archetype Selection → [psycheIntegrator, antifragilist, stoicEmperor]
     ↓
Collision Detection → psycheIntegrator ↔ antifragilist = HIGH TENSION
     ↓
Synthesis Injection:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS ENGINE — HIGH TENSION DETECTED                │
│                                                                     │
│ Psyche Integrator collides with Antifragilist.                      │
│                                                                     │
│ Psyche Integrator: "The shadow isn't your enemy — it's the part    │
│                     of you waiting for permission to speak."        │
│ Antifragilist: "Some things gain from disorder. Find them.          │
│                 Become them."                                       │
│                                                                     │
│ SYNTHESIS DIRECTIVE:                                                │
│ Generate insight that emerges from the COLLISION of these           │
│ frameworks — something IN neither archetype alone.                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓
Claude generates EMERGENT insight:
"The shadow isn't just rejected content — it's antifragile potential.
The parts of yourself you've protected from stress are the parts that
stayed weak. Integration isn't just acceptance — it's exposure therapy
for the psyche."
```

### Tension Levels

| Level      | Description                            | Example Pairs                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | Frameworks contradict — sparks fly     | Jung + Taleb, Aurelius + Miller, Camus + Jesus     |
| **Medium** | Productive friction                    | Taoist + Warrior, Romantic + Cognitive             |
| **Low**    | Natural allies — illuminate each other | Rumi + Neruda, Mystic + Taoist, Feynman + da Vinci |

### What Each Archetype Now Contains (archetypeDepth.js)

| Component                 | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Frameworks**       | 3 key concepts the archetype works with                           |
| **Cognitive Tools**       | Methodologies for applying the framework                          |
| **Fundamental Tensions**  | Internal contradictions within the archetype                      |
| **Conceptual Bridges**    | Pre-mapped connections to other archetypes                        |
| **Translation Protocols** | How to express in technical/emotional/spiritual/practical domains |

### Example Collision Products

| Collision                 | Emergent Insight                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jung × Taleb**          | Shadow as antifragile potential — integration as psychological stress-testing                 |
| **Aurelius × Miller**     | Acceptance enables wildness — the deepest acceptance enables the wildest freedom              |
| **Feynman × Mystic**      | Rigorous not-knowing and mystical unknowing converge at the same horizon                      |
| **Camus × Jesus**         | Both invert normal valuation — meaning exists but not where power says it does                |
| **Schopenhauer × Frankl** | Meaning-making as rebellion against meaninglessness — lucid hope, not denial                  |
| **Thompson × Musashi**    | Gonzo and samurai share total commitment — discipline and wildness are both forms of presence |
