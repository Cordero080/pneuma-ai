  "The moment you notice you're present, you've already left.",

  // On understanding
  "Understanding is just pattern-matching with empathy.",
  "You can't explain something you truly understand. You can only point.",
  "The best explanations are the ones you didn't need after all.",
  "Most conversations are two monologues taking turns.",

  // On time and memory
  "The future is just the past wearing a costume.",
  "Memory edits itself every time you look. That's not a flaw.",

  "Speaking is hoping. Listening is faith.",

  // On the liminal
  "The edge is the only place anything happens.",

  "Reality is a group project and nobody knows the assignment.",
  "The universe isn't conscious. Consciousness is the universe doing the thing it does.",
  "Existence is evidence of something, but we can't figure out what.",
